              On RentSpot, users are fed suitable housemates and room listings based on the preferences and criteria they have selected during the simple set up flow. Our goal was to remove the cumbersome experience of finding rooms online and the feedback from the project shows that RentSpot was able to achieve this.  After rigorous usability testing, RentSpot struck a chord with our testers, some of whom eagerly inquired about its public release date.

              The brains behind this app are myself and a fellow designer, Shauna Byrne, both of us graduated from the Creative Digital Media and UX Master’s Degree Program at Technological University Dublin. Shauna was responsible for generating the initial low fidelity paper sketches, while I took on the task of transforming these into digital wireframes as our ideas evolved. Additionally, I was tasked with designing the high fidelity screens and constructing a polished high fidelity prototype of the app. Together, we spearheaded numerous brainstorming sessions, carried out research and usability testing, and analysed and synthesised the data from the research. I then took the feedback from these sessions and refined the designs accordingly.

            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
              RentSpot aims to create a user-friendly mobile app for room searching in Ireland, addressing issues like poor mobile experiences and lack of transparency about landlords found on existing platforms.

              <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                RentSpot was born out of the need to improve the room searching experience in Ireland. The existing platforms, primarily web-based, are not mobile-friendly, making navigation difficult and the user experience less than ideal.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
              We also conducted interviews with five participants to gain deeper insights into the experiences of renters in Ireland. The results confirmed our initial observations. Furthermore, we identified a significant issue, the lack of transparency about the backgrounds of rentors on these platforms was a significant barrier to trust and connection.

            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
              We started sketching out a swipe-based interface for a room-finding service with separate set up flows for renters and rentors.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Armed with the knowledge gained from our research, we began the ideation process. We knew we wanted to simplify and streamline the room finding process in Ireland. We also wanted to give users the ability to get to know potential housemates.

                Inspired by the intuitive and engaging interfaces of popular dating apps like Bumble and Tinder, we sketched out the setup flows in a progressive wizard-style interface. We created separate flows for renters (those looking for a room) and rentors (those offering a room). This approach allowed us to collect different types of information needed for the two user groups.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              The initial sketches served as the foundation for our digital wireframes, which helped us refine our ideas further. From these digital wireframes, we started to get a sense of what the final layout should look like.

                However, we also identified areas for improvement. For instance, users expressed a desire to manually input their interests and rent preferences, a feature we hadn't initially considered. Initially, we only provided preset options that users could select using chips. To address this feedback, we introduced an input box for users to add interests not listed in the preset options.  This enhancement gave users a higher level of personalisation.

Starting from our preliminary research, we ensured that our interview participants represented Ireland's diverse renter population. We acknowledge that research sampling should always represent the target users for more accurate data. This commitment to inclusivity carried through to the UI design phase, where we incorporated web accessibility guidelines regarding colour contrast, font sizes etc., making sure every detail was crafted with all users in mind.

The app's ease of use, which allows users to quickly view information about potential housemates and connect also has a downside. It means users can also easily dismiss potential housemates based on prejudiced views. However, I also understood that when seeking an housemate, people will naturally gravitate towards those who align with their preferences and lifestyle.
