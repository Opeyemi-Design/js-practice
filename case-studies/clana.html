                        Clana features an event scheduler with customisable reminders, collaborative notes, and shared photo albums. These tools work together to make planning, coordinating, and preserving memories of events a breeze for families, friends, and other social circles.
                    </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        Clana's potential is immense, making scheduling and organising effortless among family, friends, and other types of social groups. Users can set up an event and invite people with Clana’s event scheduler. With Clana's standout feature, customisable reminders, event creators can strategically set up reminders at times when they will have the most impact, while invitees can also personalise the reminders on their own end to suit their preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
                        Another way Clana is so powerful is that it allows users to create notes and to-do lists within an event which significantly helps social groups coordinate before and after events. In addition, event participants can create albums and upload memories of the event. These features were carefully and thoughtfully crafted to make planning, scheduling and sharing memories very easy among social groups.

                        How wanting to help a family member manage and coordinate better gave birth to Clana.
                    </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        The idea for Clana originated from a conversation with a family member who expressed the desire to be better informed about family happenings and easily remember upcoming events. They also wanted a way to effortlessly share pictures of memories among the family.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
                        I asked them if apps like WhatsApp and photo sharing apps like Google photos could not solve this problem. They expressed that important information always gets lost on the family WhatsApp group chat and Google photos’ way of sharing pictures with people is complex especially for older and less tech savvy family members. The idea of a single app to handle all these tasks emerged. I envisioned an app where users could create a family group, organise, plan, and schedule events, and easily share pictures of wonderful memories. When the time came to choose an idea for my final MSc project, working on this concept was an easy decision.

                        The first wireframes and low fidelity prototype

                    <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
                        I began by focusing on the pain points and brainstorming features for a family collaboration app, then moved straight to digital wireframing in Figma to visualise these ideas.
                    </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        I wanted an app where users could sign up, create a family group, add members, and collaborate. Any member could create events, notes, to-do lists, albums, and upload photos, with everything accessible to all group members.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        I immediately started digital wireframing to help me visualise these ideas. Ideally, I would start with low-fidelity sketches using paper and pencil. However, digital tools like Figma have improved to the point where I can iterate on low-fidelity mockups more quickly, making it practical to start with it.

                            The first wireframe had five main tabs in the bottom navigation: Home, Events, Notes, Media Hub, and Chats. The Home screen layout was structured into distinct sections displaying summaries of key information, such as Upcoming Events, Upcoming Tasks, and Recent Albums.

                            Wireframes were created for three main features: event creation and shared calendar, notes, and the media hub. The event creation layout was structured into sections like Event Name, Description, Date and Time, Location, Invites, and Reminders making it easy for users to understand the content.
                        </p>

                            The events screen featured a calendar at the top and a list of upcoming events below, each list card containing details about the event. The list format allow users to quickly browse and navigate through the events list.

                            The media hub layout utilised a grid format, with each album represented by a square card with the title underneath. This grid layout is effective for visual content, allowing users to quickly scan and identify albums.

                        User testing revealed the need to expand the app's scope beyond families to include various social groups. Feedback also indicated low interest in the chat feature, as users preferred existing communication apps like WhatsApp.

                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        After creating the initial wireframes, I developed a low-fidelity prototype to gather early feedback. The first prototype tested the flow of creating an event and inviting group members to the event. With this functionality, users can create an event and invite members of their clan.

                        User testing revealed that the app needed to broaden its focus from just families to any kind of social group needing to collaborate, schedule, or plan together. Another takeaway was the low interest in the chat feature, as users already have established communication methods with people using apps like WhatsApp.

                            Using the knowledge from the first prototype and the research validation that the app needs to cater to not just families but to any kind of social group. I continued iterating on the wireframes. I removed the "Chat" tab in the bottom navigation and replaced it with "Clans" (a branded term for groups on the Clana app), aligning with the feedback that users want to be in multiple groups simultaneously.

                        I conducted another round of testing with the new iteration of the low-fidelity prototype. This prototype tested the flow of creating a notes and assigning it to a member of a group. With this functionality, users can create a note or to-do list in the planning of an event and assign that to another member of the group (clan). They could also set a deadline for the task to reminded the assignee.

                        Due to backend complexity, I shifted the app from a group-based model to an individual-focused model but this also resulted in a more streamlined user experience. This change led to a redesigned UI with simplified tabs and event-specific collaboration features.

                        While considering the app's development, I realised the complexity of structuring the app’s database for a group-based model where a user will be able to be in multiple groups simultaneously. I decided to change the approach to an individual-focused model, where each user's account is independent and not part of any group by default.

                        The new approach still retains the collaborative features from the group model but refines them for a better experience. The siloed nature allows for targeted sharing and collaboration within specific events while maintaining an overall sense of individual ownership and organisation. The app becomes more user-centric and oriented around each person's schedule and priorities.

                        The app will prioritise accessibility by adapting to users' device text settings and supporting screen readers, ensuring visually impaired individuals can navigate with ease.

                        The app will adhere to and follow the native device text sizing in the Display settings of users' phones, catering to users with low vision by allowing them to use the app in their preferred font size. The app will be fully compatible with screen readers such as VoiceOver for iOS and TalkBack for Android, ensuring that visually impaired users can navigate the app using auditory feedback.

                        Interactive elements such as buttons and links will have large touch targets (at least 9 mm by 9 mm) to accommodate users with motor impairments. Given that older adults, who are part of the target audience, may have varying levels of technological proficiency, the app will also feature a user-friendly design with clear, simple navigation and easily recognisable icons.

                        Throughout my UX career, I have always acknowledged the importance of early collaboration with engineering. Being in charge of both the design and development of this project, which requires significant backend engineering and database expertise, has given me an even finer perspective on design and engineering collaboration.

                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        As much as design drives the development of a product, engineering, especially discussions about technical feasibility, is equally important.

                    <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
                        Another point to mention is the willingness to pivot and refine an idea. During this project, I had to change a major part of how Clana works. Having an open mind and being receptive to feedback was crucial in my ability to easily pivot and find a solution to the backend complexity.

                        The app is currently in development. I will using React Native to target both iOS and Android and this page will be updated once the app is on the App Store and Play Store.
