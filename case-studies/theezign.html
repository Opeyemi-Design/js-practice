              TheeZign is a learning platform that aims to provide a structured curriculum for mastering UX design, making the learning process more organised and enjoyable compared to self-learning.

              TheeZign is a learning platform designed for individuals to help them master UX design without getting lost in the overwhelming sea of online tutorials. Unlike the unstructured nature of self-learning, TheeZign offers a meticulously organised curriculum similar to formal education. This structure not only streamlines the learning journey but also eliminates the cumbersome task of planning one’s educational path, making learning both effective and enjoyable.

              I single-handedly handled the entire UX process.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
              As the project’s sole designer, I spearheaded the entire UX research process. My responsibilities ranged from conducting initial user interviews to gain insights into the learners' needs and preferences, to executing usability tests to polish the design. My role encompassed the entire visual design spectrum, starting with basic paper sketches, progressing to digital wireframing, and culminating in the creation of polished, high-fidelity screens.

              Setting the stage: Why I worked on this project
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px scroll-reveal">
              Self-taught designers often struggle with fragmented online resources, so I wanted to work on a project aimed at improving learning experience.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
              Anyone who has entered into the design industry through self-learning understands the daunting experience of navigating through countless online tutorials and YouTube videos on UX design. This scattered approach often leads to frustration and, sadly, many abandon their journey into UX design. This was the driving force behind my involvement in this project aimed at social good.

              Understanding the barriers to self-learning

            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px scroll-reveal">
              The UX research revealed that aspiring designers struggle with information overload and lack of structure.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              To understand into the obstacles faced by aspiring UX designers, I conducted generative UX research. This involved one-on-one semi-structured interviews, guided by questions designed to explore users’ needs, frustrations, and motivations. A common theme emerged: the absence of a structured learning path led many to give up their pursuit of UX design.
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph-and-bullet-list margin-bottom-300-24px">
              <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-50-4px scroll-reveal">
                Through the research, I identified four main pain points:
              </p>
              <ul class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
                <li class="margin-bottom-50-4px scroll-reveal">Overwhelming amounts of beginner-level information online, leaving many unsure of where to start.</li>
                <li class="margin-bottom-50-4px scroll-reveal">A clear lack of structured learning paths for self-learners.</li>
                <li class="margin-bottom-50-4px scroll-reveal">A strong desire for a curated and organised repository of essential information.</li>
                <li class="margin-bottom-50-4px scroll-reveal">The prohibitive cost of formal UX education.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              Based on these insights, I crafted two personas that summarised the target users. These personas guided my decisions and ensured my solutions were firmly rooted in the real needs and challenges of those I aimed to help.

              TheeZign aims to provide a more streamlined journey for UX design beginners compared to existing platforms, which can be overwhelming for newcomers despite their similar goals of helping people start careers in UX design.

              CareerFoundry, General Assembly, UX Design Institute, Interaction Design Foundation, and YouTube are popular routes for those embarking on a UX design career. The first four are paid programs, with Interaction Design Foundation offering the most affordable option, although with a less structured curriculum compared to its counterparts. YouTube is completely free to self learn, but it’s also the least structured.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              Their goals are similar, and they all aim to help beginners reach their career goals.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              A potential area for enhancement across these platforms is the provision of a more streamlined and direct journey from absolute beginner to UX designer. Someone looking to transition when visiting these platforms for the first time might feel a bit overwhelmed with the different courses and modules on the homepage begging to be taken.

            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px scroll-reveal">
              The design process began with a sitemap and rough sketches, progressing through paper wireframes for various devices, and culminating in digital wireframes used to create a low-fidelity prototype for early feedback.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              To design TheeZign (yes, that’s on purpose, lol), a desktop-first strategy was adopted because users, particularly those keen on learning design, would predominantly access the platform via desktop. This preference for desktops is due to their suitability for design tasks and learning activities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              The initial phase involved drafting a sitemap to outline the website's structure, serving as a blueprint for the subsequent design stages.

                I then started working on different  rough sketches to put the idea in motion.
              </p>
              <div class="media-container margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">

                After that, I chose different elements from these sketches to make a single paper wireframe. One of the goals while drawing these sketches was to create clearly defined sections for easy information scanning on the homepage.

              The usability study of the low-fidelity prototype revealed that while users easily started their first class, they desired additional features like class notes and module outcome previews.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px scroll-reveal">
              I conducted a usability study with users using the low-fidelity prototype with two objectives in mind,  assessing the ease with which users could initiate their first class and collecting qualitative feedback on their overall experience.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
              5 out of 5 participants had no difficulty with signing up and starting their first class. However, I got other insightful feedback with 4 out of 5 participants expressing their desire to be able to access notes and transcripts from the classes and 3 out of 5 participants wanting a way to know module outcomes before beginning each module.

              I focused on accessibility by making legibility and readability a core focus

              I created a clean, accessible layout with thoughtful use of visual elements to enhance readability, while ensuring compliance with accessibility guidelines.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
              I made use of white space, clear fonts, a simple colour scheme and border lines to create a visually balanced design that aids in focusing on the content without feeling overwhelmed. I made sure to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and that there is sufficient contrast between the text and background colours, which is important for users with visual impairments.

              This project is personal to me because I know what it’s like trying to self learn. I hope one day I can pull resources together between myself and other designers to set up this free UX design learning platform.
