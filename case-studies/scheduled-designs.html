              The impact of scheduled designs
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
              Scheduled Designs automates the process of setting overlay designs for ads, it has been highly praised by our users for its positive impact on their work-life balance. It allows users to pre-schedule designs, eliminating the need for manual effort during inconvenient hours.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Scheduled Designs is one of the most well received features I’ve ever designed due to it positive impact on the work-life balance of our users. These are digital advertising professionals such as customer success managers, account directors, and paid social campaign managers. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              The essence of the Scheduled Designs feature is its automation capabilities, which drastically reduce the manual effort previously required from our users. Before its launch, users had to manually set overlay designs for their ads to go live on platforms like Facebook, often during inconvenient hours or over weekends. With the introduction of Scheduled Designs, this cumbersome process was eliminated. Users can now pre-schedule these tasks, allowing them to focus more on strategic aspects of their work instead of getting bogged down by repetitive tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
              This feature not only fostered a better work-life balance but also boosted overall productivity. Our internal users and external clients have reported a significant positive impact, appreciating the freedom and flexibility it provides them.

              Let’s rewind to start from the beginning
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
              Scheduled designs aimed to streamline operations, reduce manual oversight, and improve ad delivery effectiveness, particularly for time-sensitive promotions like holiday sales or events occurring outside regular working hours.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              This project was a feature I designed at Kargo Commerce, which is the social advertising division of Kargo, a leader in digital advertising technology. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Our primary goal for this feature was to create a solution that would allow users to schedule the launch of overlay designs for ads across various publishers. In the digital advertising realm and in the context of social advertising, "publishers" refer to entities that own digital advertisement spaces, such as Facebook and Pinterest.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Before this feature was launched, there was a lot of tedious effort involved anytime overlay designs had to go live at odd hours, on public holidays or for seasonal promotions such as holidays sales. For instance, if a client wanted to run a Black Friday promotion, our users had to ensure the overlay was activated at midnight and remember to update the designs once the promotion concluded. This process not only demanded excessive manual intervention but also led to less than optimal ad delivery.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
              Recognising the inefficiency of this workflow, the need for a more streamlined process was clear. We then set out to develop a solution that would simplify these operations, reducing the need for manual oversight and enhancing the overall effectiveness of ad delivery.
            </p>

          <div class="margin-bottom-850-120px">

              Highlighting the wonderful team that worked on this.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
              I collaborated closely with my product manager and my engineering team to create designs that met real user needs, with the help of my project manager who always ensured that everyone could contribute effectively.
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              I had the privilege of leading the design efforts on this project. Throughout the process, I collaborated closely with my exceptional Product Manager, Helen Fulkes. Together, we engaged in brainstorming sessions and user interviews to ensure the designs met real user needs.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Bringing our ideas and the designs to life were our skilled engineers: Eric Grehan, Cronin-O’Mahoney, and Antonio Del Castillo. Their skills was pivotal in transforming our design concepts into functioning features.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
              The project's success is also greatly attributed to Stella McKay-Firth, our Project Manager. Her exceptional management skills  kept the project on track, ensuring that every team member could effectively contribute to our shared goal.

            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px">
              The solution features a modal interface with intuitive controls for setting dates, times, and durations, as well as a toggle switch for progressive disclosure of advanced scheduling options, all aimed at simplifying the setup process and addressing user pain points effectively.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Due to confidentiality agreements with Kargo, I'm limited in the details I can share publicly about the interface. However, I'll outline the essential aspects that demonstrate my approach in this case study.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              Leveraging Kargo Commerce's Component Library made the UI design process smooth and efficient. It eliminated the need to extensively focus on style guides, colours, and component design, allowing me to concentrate on strategic problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500 margin-bottom-200-16px">
              My primary goal was to address user pain points effectively and a key aspect of my design strategy was to prioritise simplicity and clarity, ensuring the setup process for scheduled designs is straightforward.

                My solution features a modal interface that simplifies essential scheduling functions such as selecting start dates/times, setting time zones, and determining the duration when the overlay designs will be live. These core functionalities form the backbone of this feature.

                Scheduled designs dramatically reduced the manual workload for our users and clients. By enabling them to schedule overlay designs in advance, we streamlined their workflow, allowing for things like seasonal promotions to be scheduled ahead of time. This means that even when users are away, their overlay designs go live as planned without the need for manual oversight.

                Kargo Commerce has staff all over Europe and North America, with a even more diverse list of clients all over the world including the middle east. When managing campaigns for clients in different time zones, scheduled designs became crucial to ensure that the overlay designs are displayed at appropriate local times, regardless of where the campaign manager is located. This ensured that campaigns reached target audiences in different time zones without manual intervention, leading to improved campaign effectiveness.

            <p class="paragraph-large fw-regular text-color-500">
              Scheduled designs really changed the way our users worked and managed ad campaigns on Facebook. Previously, users faced the challenge of manually activating overlay designs for multiple client accounts across various time zones, a process that was both complex and time-consuming. Now, thanks to our innovative solution, this cumbersome task has been streamlined into a simple, intuitive flow, allowing for the automation of what was once a tedious process. This change not only saves our users valuable time but also enhances their overall workflow efficiency.
