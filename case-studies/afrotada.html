              The success behind the new AfroTada website was a team of dedicated professionals. I had the privilege of leading the redesign as the Lead Product Designer, but I also worked with Co-founders Zainab Olaitan and Simotwo Zainabu who supported this initiative when I pitched it. The technical side was handled by Lead Software Engineer Olabayo Balogun and Software Engineer Adedayo Aturu.

            <h2 class="heading-small fw-medium margin-bottom-300-24px scroll-reveal">
              The outdated website required a modern redesign and improved user experience with a focus on faster content access, responsive design, and addressing identified user pain points.

                I started this project started with a comprehensive analysis of the old website. While the platform was functional and usability was not an issue, the lemon-green background and bright hues of the user interface (UI) began to feel outdated. There was a growing need for a fresher, more modern interface and experience.

              Asides from updating the interface, it was crucial to listen to our users and understand existing pain points. Through extensive research like usability testing and semi-structured user interviews, we discovered that users and visitors of the website wanted to be able to get to content faster without even leaving the homepage, we needed a UI and UX overhaul that would allow users to access content swiftly and without unnecessary navigation.

                With a clearly defined mission, we embarked on the redesign process. This began with the creation of digital wireframes to explore various layout options. Throughout this initial exploration, the goal was to create something that will improve content discoverability compared to the old website, allowing users to engage with content more effortlessly. These wireframes served as the groundwork for the design of high-fidelity mockups which followed.

                Before diving fully into the high fidelity mockups, I meticulously created a UI Kit. This kit served as the foundation of the new interface, ensuring a consistent user experience across the platform and speeding up the UI design process. This kit was instrumental in creating a cohesive look and feel.

              Armed with the UI Kit, I started working on the high fidelity mockups. I wanted to introduce a modern aesthetic while retaining some elements of the vibrant colours in the old website that echos the African heritage. Once the homepage was completed, the design of the remaining pages was completed swiftly as I was able to quickly reuse and even repurpose some components which sped up my UI design process.

                I got rid of the old grid section that displayed the different content categories on the website. In its place, I introduced filters at the top, allowing users to effortlessly switch between categories of articles and content. This improvement significantly enhanced user navigation efficiency, enabling users to explore categories with a single click, a stark contrast to the previous design, which required returning to the homepage to view articles from another category.

                I also populated the homepage with more articles on initial homepage loading unlike the old website where users could only see 3 articles. Now, users can discover more content directly from the homepage on initial load and can load additional articles by simply clicking the 'See more articles' button at the bottom, without the need to navigate away from the homepage.

                My personal favourite feature is the interactive African map. Users can hover over and click on any country on the map to learn more about it and access country-specific articles.

              I carried out an A/B test to compare the old website with the redesigned version. I asked participants to explore the homepage, scroll and navigate through, and read articles on both versions of the site. After this activity, I asked them to choose which version of the website they preferred. The outcome was clear, 12 out of 15 participants preferred the new design. This strong preference across board for the redesigned website validated my designs and indicated that the new look would appeal more to our audience.
