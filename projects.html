                  Clana was designed to address common challenges within social groups. Challenges like forgetting significant events and tasks, difficulties when trying to coordinate schedules, and friction when trying to share memorable pictures.

                  With Clana, users can set up events and send invitations through the event scheduler. One of Clana’s standout features is the customisable reminders, which can be tailored by both event creators and invitees to ensure the reminders are received at the most impactful times.

                  Clana also enhances coordination by enabling users to create notes and to-do lists within events, making it easier to manage tasks before and after gatherings. Participants can also create albums and upload memories, making it a comprehensive solution for planning, scheduling, and sharing experiences within social groups.

                  “Scheduled Designs” aimed to solve the problem of manual and time-consuming scheduling of overlay designs for our internal and external users who are digital advertising professionals. Before the introduction of Scheduled Designs, users had to set these designs to go live on platforms like Facebook manually, often during inconvenient hours or weekends. This process was not only cumbersome but also disrupted their work-life balance.

                  The Scheduled Designs feature automated this task, allowing users to pre-schedule their designs, thereby reducing manual effort, enhancing productivity, and fostering a better work-life balance.

                  At AfroTada, I redesigned the platform leading to a 39% rise in the average number of monthly visitors.

                <p class="paragraph-small fw-regular margin-bottom-500-64px text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
                  The redesign project aimed to modernise the AfroTada website's outdated design and improve user experience. Our old site, while functional, had a dated look with its lemon-green background and bright colours. We needed to create a fresher interface and address user pain points.

                  Through research, we found that visitors wanted quicker access to more content from the homepage, without excessive navigation. We also needed to make the site responsive across different devices.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-small fw-regular margin-bottom-100-12px text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
                  The redesign was a great success. The new look created buzz and boosted engagement significantly. Over the following months, we maintained a 39% rise in average monthly visitors compared to the old site. These numbers show that the new design not only looked better, but also improved the overall user experience, making the site more attractive and easier to use.

                  We started this project to fix an obvious pain point in our article publishing process at AfroTada. Our old method was slow and complicated. We had to manually collect articles from our writers via  email, then our developers had to hardcode each one into the website. This took up a lot of time and wasn't very efficient. We needed a way to make this whole process easier and faster.

                  The new dashboard I designed did more than just solve our initial problem, it had a surprising extra benefit. Not only did it save us hours of work each week, but it also led to three times as many people contributing articles to our platform.

                  During my M.Sc. program, I designed a feature to improve video sharing experience on YouTube.

                <p class="paragraph-small fw-regular margin-bottom-500-64px text-color-500 scroll-reveal">
                  The feature aimed to tackle the cumbersome process of sharing YouTube videos with friends. Users currently have to manually copy links, switch to a separate messaging app to find their friends, and then send the links. This method is inefficient and makes it difficult to keep track of previously shared videos, creating unnecessary hassle for users.

                  The solution I designed, "YouTube In-App Sharing", potentially has a significant positive impact. By allowing users to connect with friends and share videos directly within the YouTube app, it creates a space for sharing interests natively and brings users closer to their community. This feature not only has the potential to boost user engagement but it also makes video sharing more efficient, enhancing the overall user experience.

                  I designed RentSpot to tackle the problems with room searching in Ireland. The existing websites weren't mobile-friendly, which made them hard to use on phones. Interviews with renters confirmed this issue and revealed another problem: people didn't trust landlords because there wasn't enough information about them on these platforms.

                  The solution, RentSpot, makes finding rooms much easier. It shows users suitable housemates and rooms based on preferences they’ve set. RentSpot was tested and the feedback was very positive. Some of the testers were so impressed that they asked when the app would be available.

                  In this case study, I demonstrated the ability to reflect on my work and how it impacts users and the society at large. This reflection is crucial in UX design, as our work doesn't exist in isolation. The skill of thoughtful consideration is vital in designing software products that have a net positive overall effect on society.

                  As someone who's been through the self-learning process in UX design, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be. Trying to piece together a coherent learning path from countless online tutorials and YouTube videos is a real challenge. It's frustrating and can often lead people to give up on their UX design dreams altogether. This widespread problem was the main reason I worked on this project.

                  To address this issue, I created TheeZign, a learning platform that takes the guesswork out of mastering UX design. Unlike the scattered approach of self-learning, TheeZign offers a well-structured curriculum. By providing a clear, organised learning path, the need for learners to plan their own educational journey is eliminated. This approach not only makes the learning process more effective but also much more enjoyable, helping aspiring designers stick with their studies and achieve their goals.
